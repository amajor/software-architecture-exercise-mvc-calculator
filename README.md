Software Architecture & Design
# MVC Calculator
Model-View-Controller (MVC) is one of the well-known architectural patterns typically used to develop user interfaces.

In this exercise, you are given a GUI-based Python implementation of a simple calculator (see the file `main.py`). The design follows the MVC pattern.

1. Download the file `main.py` to your computer.
2. Study the code and understand the MVC structure.
3. Perform the following modifications to understand the structure further.
    1. Add a decimal point to the user interface so that the new calculator supports input and calculation of decimal point numbers.
    2. Support keyboard entry. In other words, the user can use the keyboard to input numbers and operations.
    3. Keyboard and mouse entry (clicking on buttons) must be able to run side by side.
